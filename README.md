This is my digital uptime and productivity tracker, implemented in my laptop for development and research purpose (No puns intended haha)

# My Active Time: [![Tracker](https://img.shields.io/badge/TRACK-red.svg?&style=for-the-badge)](uptime.txt)

# Purpose:

Track when I log into my laptop to do work related stuffs. A fun little automation script to run at each startup and control my productivity time management.
